RayDynamics Model provides a Novel and holistic approach for White Blood Cell (WBC) movement dynamics

Following Figure displays a plot showing how the WBC speed changes under different scenarios (by varying Pd and Cr). It helps us to compare which mechanism results in faster speeds under different conditions. 
* We'll vary the parameters Pd and Cr (coefficients for paddling and crawling) over a range to simulate various scenarios.
* The other influencing factors, such as s_w and S_surface (surface adhesion strength), will be kept constant for this simple comparison.
* We'll plot the resulting speeds for both mechanisms over the range of varying parameters.
